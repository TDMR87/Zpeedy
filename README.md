Change the amount of data to be downloaded depending on your bandwidth.

Your download speed will be displayed in megabytes (MB/s, megabytes per second), NOT in megabits (Mbps, megabits per second). 
This gives a more realistic approximation of your download speed, since filesizes are usually displayed in bytes, not bits.
